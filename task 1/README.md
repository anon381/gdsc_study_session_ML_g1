# Task 1 - File Descriptions

- `numpy.py` — Creates a NumPy array from [11, 56, 80, 39, 56], computes mean, max, and sum, and prints the results.
- `numpy.ipynb` — Same example in a Jupyter Notebook, split into interactive cells (import, create array, compute, print).

Run (PowerShell):

```
cd "task 1"
python numpy.py
# or
jupyter notebook numpy.ipynb
```

That's all — short descriptions of what each file does.
